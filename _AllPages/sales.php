                                                booking agent will help the customer to choose a carrier that can meet
                                                their specific needs. This may involve comparing rates, transit times,
                                                and other factors to find the best carrier for the shipment.

                                                Book the shipment: After a carrier has been chosen, the freight booking
                                                agent will book the shipment with the carrier. This involves providing
                                                all of the necessary information about the shipment, including the
                                                pickup and delivery locations, the shipment details, and any special
                                                requirements.

                                                Track the shipment: Once the shipment has been booked, the freight
                                                booking agent will provide the customer with tracking information so
                                                that they can monitor the progress of their shipment in real-time. This
                                                helps to ensure that the shipment arrives at its destination on time and
                                                in good condition.
